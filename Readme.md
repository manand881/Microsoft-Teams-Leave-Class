# Microsoft Teams Leave Class

This Repository contains a script to automate the action of leaving a class or a meeting at set time.

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install the [keyboard](https://pypi.org/project/keyboard/) package.

## Usage
Enter the time at which you wish to leave class in the **HH:MM:SS** format and it'll do the rest.

## Appeal

I do no wish for this script to be used in a demeaning or demoralizing manner to any teacher or employer. I have made it just because i like to make small projects and have the inclination. Please use this is a respectable manner or for educational purposes only.
